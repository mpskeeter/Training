#The Raven
by Edgar Allen Poe

Once upon a midnight dreaty as I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious

Gentle Rappings

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morriw0vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow form the lost Lenore
From that rare and radient maiden whom the andles names Lenore
Nameless here forevermore

And the silky sad uncertain rustling
